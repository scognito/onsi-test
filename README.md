# onsi

A new Flutter project.

## Project Information

### Simulated Network Requests

- Network requests are simulated to mimic server interactions
- Data models are created to represent the response from the server

### Translation Handling

- While translations are an integral part of the application, the project opts for a hardcoded approach. Typically, I use the `intl`
  package for internationalization, but for this exercise, I used a more straightforward implementation

### Architecture

- The project adopts a simplified version of the MVVM architecture, emphasizing a clear separation of concerns. This architectural
  pattern enhances code organization, readability, and maintainability

## Packages

1. **google_fonts:**
    - Enables easy integration of custom fonts

2. **provider:**
    - Facilitates efficient state management, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for handling application state
